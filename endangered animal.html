                        <h3>AFRICAN FOREST ELEPHANT</h3>
                            <p>African forest elephants are the elusive cousin of the African savanna elephant.
                                They inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa.
                                African forest elephants are smaller than African savanna elephants, the other African elephant species. 
                                Their ears are more oval-shaped and their tusks are straighter and point downward
                                Forest elephants also have a much slower reproductive rate than savanna elephants, 
                                so they cannot bounce back from population declines as quickly at the same rate. 
                                Their last strongholds are located in Gabon and the Republic of Congo,
                                with smaller populations remaining in other African countries
                                African forest elephants live in family groups of up to 20 individuals and
                                forage on leaves, grasses, seeds, fruit, and tree bark.

                        <h3>AMUR LEOPARD</h3>
                            <p>People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa but in the Russian Far East,
                                a rare subspecies has adapted to life in the temperate forests that make up the northern-most part of the species
                                range. Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour.
                                This incredible animal has been reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically   
                                The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are 
                                not taken by other predators. It has been reported that some males stay with females after mating, and may even 
                                help with rearing the young. Several males sometimes follow and fight over a female. They live for 10-15 years, 
                                and in captivity up to 20 years. The Amur leopard is also known as the Far East leopard, the Manchurian leopard 
                                or the Korean leopard.

                        <h3>BLACK RHINO</h3>
                            <p>Among black and white rhinos, black rhinos are the smaller of the two African rhino species. Black and white rhinos 
                                can be distinguished by the shape of their lips. Black rhinos have hooked upper lips, whereas white rhinos are 
                                characterized by a square lip. Black rhinos are browsers, rather than grazers, meaning they are herbivores who do 
                                not feed on low-growing vegetation, and their pointed lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and trees. They have 
                                two horns, which grow continually from the skin at their base throughout the rhino’s life.The front horn is longer 
                                than the rear horn, averaging around 19 inches long.The population of black rhinos declined dramatically in the 
                                20th century at the hands of European hunters and settlers. Between 1960 and 1995, black rhino numbers dropped by 
                                a sobering 98%, to less than 2,500 individuals. Since then, the species has made a tremendous comeback from the 
                                brink of extinction. Thanks to persistent conservation efforts across Africa, black rhino numbers have doubled from 
                                their historic low 20 years ago to more than 6,000 today. However, the black rhino is still considered critically 
                                endangered, and a lot of work remains to bring their population up to even a fraction of what it once was.

                                <p>Bornean orangutan populations have declined by more than 50% over the past 60 years, and the species' habitat has 
                                    been reduced by at least 55% over the past 20 years.
                                    The Bornean orangutan differs in appearance from the Sumatran orangutan, with a broader face and shorter beard and 
                                    also slightly darker in color. Three subspecies are recognized, each localized to different parts of the island.
                                    Northwest Bornean orangutans are the most threatened subspecies. Its habitat has been seriously affected by logging and hunting, and a mere 
                                    1,500 individuals or so remain. Many habitat patches in the area are small and fragmented.
                                    Northeast Bornean orangutans are the smallest in size and found in Sabah and eastern Kalimantan as far as the Mahakam River.
                                    Central Bornean orangutans are the subspecies with the most animals, with at least 35,000 individuals.

                            <h3>HAWKSBILL TURTLE</h3>
                                <p>Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak. They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales on 
                                    their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable 
                                    and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets.Hawksbills are found mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans, 
                                    predominantly in coral reefs. They feed mainly on sponges by using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from 
                                    crevices on the reef, but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group 
                                    of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.

                                <p>This subspecies of the western gorilla is very similar in appearance to the more numerous western lowland gorilla, 
                                    but subtle differences can be found in the skull and tooth dimensions. Cross River gorillas live in a region 
                                    populated by many humans who have encroached upon the gorilla’s territory—clearing forests for timber and to create 
                                    fields for agriculture and livestock. Poaching occurs in the forests as well, and the loss of even a few of these 
                                    gorillas has a detrimental effect on such a small population.Efforts to protect these animals are focused on 
                                    securing the forests that house them. WWF and partners have worked with the governments of Cameroon and Nigeria 
                                    to create a protected area for the Cross River gorilla that spans the border of these two nations.

                        <h3>AFRICAN WILD DOG</h3>
                            <p>The wild dog is one of the world’s most endangered mammals. The largest populations remain in southern Africa and 
                                the southern part of East Africa (especially Tanzania and northern Mozambique).Wild dogs are social and gather in 
                                packs of around ten individuals, but some packs number more than 40. They are opportunistic predators that hunt 
                                medium-sized ruminants, such as gazelles. In a sprint, African wild dogs can reach speeds of more than 44 miles 
                                per hour.Major threats to the survival of wild dogs include accidental and targeted killings by humans, viral 
                                diseases like rabies and distemper, habitat loss and competition with larger predators like lions. Conflicts occur 
                                when wild dogs come in contact with people whose livelihoods rest largely on livestock and agriculture. Problems 
                                arise when expanding human activities decrease the habitat for available prey for wild dogs.

                        <h3>BLUE WHALE</h3>
                            <p>The blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, weighing as much as 200 tons (approximately 33 elephants). 
                                The blue whale has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Its stomach can hold one ton of krill and it needs to 
                                eat about four tons of krill each day. They are the loudest animals on Earth and are even louder than a jet engine. 
                                Their calls reach 188 decibels, while a jet reaches 140 decibels. Their low frequency whistle can be heard for 
                                hundreds of miles and is probably used to attract other blue whales.Whales are at the top of the food chain and have 
                                an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. During the 20th century, the blue whale was an 
                                important whaling target and even after it was protected and commercial whaling stopped in 1966, exploitation efforts 
                                by the former Soviet Union persisted.

                        <h3>BONOBO</h3>
                            <p>Bonobos and chimpanzees look very similar and both share 98.7% of their DNA with humans—making the two species our 
                                closest living relatives. Bonobos are usually a bit smaller, leaner, and darker than chimpanzees. Their society is 
                                also different—bonobo groups tend to be more peaceful and are led by females. They also maintain relationships and 
                                settle conflicts through sex. However, bonobo life isn’t entirely violence-free; if two groups of bonobos come 
                                together, they may engage in serious fighting.Wild bonobos can only be found in forests south of the Congo River 
                                in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They weren’t recognized as a separate species until 1929. As the last 
                                great ape to be scientifically described, much remains unknown about the bonobo—including the extent of its 
                                geographic range. Efforts to survey the species over the past two decades have been hampered by the remote nature of 
                                its habitat, the patchiness of its distribution, and years of civil unrest within the DRC.Civil unrest and 
                                communities facing economic barriers in the area around the bonobos’ forests have contributed to bonobo poaching 
                                and deforestation. Though the size of the bonobo population is largely unknown, it has likely been declining for 
                                the last 30 years. Scientists believe the decline will continue for the next 45 to 55 years due to the bonobo’s low 
                                reproductive rate and growing threats.

                            <p>Dolphins are one of the oldest creatures in the world along with some species of turtles, crocodiles and sharks. 
                                The Ganges river dolphin was officially discovered in 1801. Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna 
                                and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. But the species is extinct from most of its early distribution 
                                ranges.The Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is essentially blind. They hunt by emitting 
                                ultrasonic sounds, which bounces off of fish and other prey, enabling them to “see” an image in their mind. 
                                They are frequently found alone or in small groups, and generally a mother and calf travel together. Calves are 
                                chocolate brown at birth and then have grey-brown smooth, hairless skin as adults. Females are larger than males 
                                and give birth once every two to three years to only one calf.

                                <p>Monarch butterflies embark on a marvelous migratory phenomenon. They travel between 1,200 and 2,800 miles or more 
                                    from the northeast United States, and southeast Canada to the mountain forests in central Mexico, where they find 
                                    the right climate conditions to hibernate from the beginning of November to mid-March. The monarch butterfly is 
                                    known by scientists as Danaus plexippus, which in Greek literally means "sleepy transformation." The name evokes 
                                    the species' ability to hibernate and metamorphize. Adult monarch butterflies possess two pairs of brilliant 
                                    orange-red wings, featuring black veins and white spots along the edges. Males, who possess distinguishing black 
                                    dots along the veins of their wings, are slightly bigger than females. Each adult butterfly lives only about four 
                                    to five weeks.Milkweed is the only plant on which monarchs will lay their eggs and the only source of food for baby 
                                    caterpillars. But urban planning and agricultural expansion have paved and plowed over millions of acres of milkweed. 
                                    Planting the right species of milkweed in a given area can help these amazing butterflies and other pollinators thrive.

                                <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in 
                                    China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.
                                    Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely 
                                    on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. 
                                    They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.A newborn panda is about the size of a stick 
                                    of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up

                        <h3>VAQUITA</h3>
                            <p>Vaquita, the world's rarest marine mammal, is on the edge of extinction. The plight of cetaceans—whales, dolphins, and 
                                porpoises—as a whole is exemplified by the rapid decline of the vaquita in Mexico, with about 10 individuals remaining. 
                                This little porpoise wasn't discovered until 1958 and a little over half a century later, we are on the brink of losing 
                                them forever. Vaquita are often caught and drowned in gillnets used by illegal fishing operations in marine protected 
                                areas within Mexico's Gulf of California. The population has dropped drastically in the last few years.The vaquita has 
                                a large dark ring around its eyes and dark patches on its lips that form a thin line from the mouth to the pectoral 
                                fins. Its top—the dorsal surface—is dark gray, its sides are pale gray, and its underside—the ventral surface—is white 
                                with long, light gray markings. Newborn vaquita have darker coloration and a wide gray fringe of color that runs from 
                                the head to the flukes, passing through the dorsal and pectoral fins. They are most often found close to shore in the 
                                Gulf's shallow waters, although they quickly swim away if a boat approaches.

                    <h3>BLUEFIN TUNA</h3>
                            <p>Bluefin are the largest tunas and can live up to 40 years. They migrate across all oceans and can dive deeper than 3,000 
                                feet. Bluefin tuna are made for speed: built like torpedoes, have retractable fins and their eyes are set flush to their 
                                body. They are tremendous predators from the moment they hatch, seeking out schools of fish like herring, mackerel, and 
                                even eels. They hunt by sight and have the sharpest vision of any bony fish. There are three species of bluefin: Atlantic 
                                (the largest and most endangered), Pacific, and Southern. Most catches of the Atlantic bluefin tuna are taken from the 
                                Mediterranean Sea, which is the most important bluefin tuna fishery in the world.

                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                            <p>There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris 
                                sondaica). The largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for 
                                hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On 
                                average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may 
                                be produced within five months.Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity 
                                at age three or four for females and four or five years for males. Juvenile mortality is high, however—about half of all 
                                cubs do not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild.Males of the 
                                larger subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds. For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda 
                                tiger—the upper range is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males are heavier than females.
